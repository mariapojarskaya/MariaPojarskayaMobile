1.	Setup project that has been discussed in the class.
Make sure you can run both tests (native and web) successfully.

2.	For existing native mobile autotest try to use another locator (xpath, classname, ?).
Define these locators using Appium Inspector. Are there any difference with id version?

5037(native port)
52007517ee2515cd device
ip: 192.168.100.2
device product:j5y17ltexxm
model:Xenium W6610
device:j5y17lte
transport_id:7


3.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?

    The only difference was – the “deviceName”  capability

4.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?

    At first could not manage how to start session on real device. PHILIPS Xenium W6610
    It came out that the MIUI 8 and above works strange.
    The device asked me to insert the SIM card6 so after that I could turn on “Install via USB” option.
    So test was passed

5.	What should be improved/changed in existing test code? Why, for what?

    No hardcore values nor absolute path
    Thread.sleep should be removed
    The project structure should be fixed
    These are not test cause they have no asserts
