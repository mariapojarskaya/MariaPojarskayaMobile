1.	Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?
    Мы не множим объекты, когда вызываем драйвер

2.	Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?

    in ex2 I have added static field to test classes

     in ex3 I have added type = {$type} in properties,
     so that is how I let the Driver know which *.properties it should load

3.	Add checks of other fields and their titles (Contact Name, Contact phone) in “native” test

4.	Optional: Add keyboard presence check  in “native” test.
    DONE
5.	Which checks would you place in the “web” test?
    Title
    URL
    Elements Presence

6.	Implement checks for “web” test in code and try to use.
