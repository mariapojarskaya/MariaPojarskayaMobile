1.	Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices
 (reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities).
 Locally installed Appium DT doesn’t need these parameters,
 but for Appium server of Mobile Farm (Minsk, SPb) it’s mandatory.
 done

2.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device on Mobile Test Farm.
Run test with your changes. Did test pass?

Test passed without specifying certain device.
Test passed with udid

3.	Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Passed after some work with Driver.class.

4.	What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
I made page object for both native and web tests
Also made some enums for constants: package names, keys from properties, messages for exceptions
